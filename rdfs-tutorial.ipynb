    "- RDF semantics can be used for example to create orders from guests. Each order is then a new instance, and can be forwarded to kitchen, so that a chef can directly see what the guest ordered and can take into consideration any kind of exceptions + allergies and such.\n",
    "- RDF semantics can of course also be used to list the items on the menu. The current graph could perhaps be expanded with the quantities of each ingredient. Then, if there are a large number of orders for the same meal, the chef can easily change the serving size to create exactly enough food in one batch.\n",
    "- RDF semantics can also be used to create some kind of inventory/stock management system, where a chef could indicate which ingredients are almost out of stock, so that it can be forwarded to the person that takes care of the inventory. "

    "6. As mentioned before, the quantities of each of the ingredients used in the recipes might come in handy. Perhaps also a property such as *methodOfPreparation*, to explain how a vegetable/fruit or other ingredient can be used or prepared (especially for tropical ingredients). In line with the latter, perhaps also a *usedIn* property for the ingredient to specify in which recipes this ingredient is used. We could even extend the KR further by introducing classes like *KitchenUtensils*, describing the utensils that are used in the kitchen, such as different types of knives, kitchen machine, cutting boards et cetera. These can also be linked to the ingredients then, so the chef directly knows what to use or what the options are regarding the preparation of certain ingredients."
